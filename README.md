# Mike Yanagisawa (MBY) Financials Website

Contains experiments for financial tools. Builds on top of a Databricks server that houses financial information. 

Updates:
- 6/3/25: The Databricks server ended up being pretty expensive, so we'll use a budget server (i.e. CSV flat files that work like SQL servers, for our small set of data).
