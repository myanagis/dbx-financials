[Summary: This section of the document contains the company's significant accounting policies, including information on the nature of operations, principles of consolidation, fiscal year structure, accounting guidance updates, cash and cash equivalents, inventories, and trade accounts receivable.]

### NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

*Nature of Operations*

We are a global materials science and digital identification solutions company. We are Making PossibleTM products and solutions that help advance the industries we serve, providing branding and information solutions that optimize labor and supply chain efficiency, reduce waste, advance sustainability, circularity and transparency, and better connect brands and consumers. We design and develop labeling and functional materials, radio-frequency identification ("RFID") inlays and tags, software applications that connect the physical and digital, and offerings that enhance branded packaging and carry or display information that improves the customer experience. We serve an array of industries worldwide, including home and personal care, apparel, general retail, e-commerce, logistics, food and grocery, pharmaceuticals and automotive.

*Principles of Consolidation*

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

*Fiscal Year*

Our fiscal years have generally consisted of 52 weeks, with every fifth or sixth fiscal year consisting of 53 weeks; our 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years consisted of 52-week periods ending December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Subsequent to fiscal year-end 2024, in January 2025, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved a change to our previous 52- or 53-week fiscal year generally ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 to a fiscal year coincident with the calendar year. Our 2025 fiscal year that began on December 29, 2024 will end on December 31, 2025 and fiscal years 2026 and beyond will begin on January 1 and end on December 31.

*Accounting Guidance Updates*

*Segment Disclosures*

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we adopted guidance that requires additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. See Note 15, “Segment and Disaggregated Revenue Information,” for more information.

*Use of Estimates*

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the date of our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. As the effects of future events cannot be determined, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.

*Cash and Cash Equivalents*

Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash on hand, deposits in banks, cash-in-transit, and bank drafts and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased or received. The carrying value of these assets approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

*Inventories*

We state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value and categorize them as raw materials, work-in-progress or finished goods. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. We record inventory that is damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving to cost of products sold and establish a lower cost basis for that inventory. Slow-moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be recognized partially or fully to cost of products sold depending on the type of product, level of usage and length of time the product has been included in inventory.

*Trade Accounts Receivable*

We record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount. Our allowances for credit losses reflect customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable values. We record these allowances based on estimates related to the financial

Table of Contents

condition of customers; the aging of receivable balances; our historical collection experience; and current and expected future macroeconomic and market conditions.

*Property, Plant and Equipment*

We generally compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, ranging from ten to 45 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the term of the associated lease. We expense maintenance and repair costs as incurred; we capitalize renewals and improvements. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the accounts are relieved of the cost and the related accumulated depreciation, with any resulting gain or loss included in net income.

*Leases*

Our leases primarily relate to office and warehouse space, machinery, transportation, and equipment for information technology. We determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For lease accounting purposes, we do not separate lease and nonlease components, nor do we record operating or finance lease assets and liabilities for short-term leases. We have options to renew or terminate some of our leases. We evaluate renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date and over the lease term to determine if we are reasonably certain to exercise these options. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. We recognize expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with variable lease payments recognized in the periods in which they are incurred.

*Software*

We capitalize software costs incurred during the application development stage of software development, including costs incurred for design, coding, installation to hardware, testing, and upgrades and enhancements that provide the software or hardware with additional functionalities and capabilities. We expense software costs, including internal and external training costs and maintenance costs, incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation and/or operation stage. Capitalized software, which is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally between five and ten years.

*Cloud Computing Arrangements*

We capitalize certain costs incurred during the application development stage of implementation under a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. We expense costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation and/or operation stage. Capitalized implementation costs, which are included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting arrangement plus optional renewal periods, which is generally between five and ten years.

*Venture Investments*

We primarily invest in privately held companies and utilize the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, measuring them at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in an orderly transaction. Venture investments that are publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The carrying value of our venture investments is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 9, “Fair Value Measurements,” for more information.

*Impairment of Long-lived Assets*

We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are determined not to be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected from the applicable asset or asset group’s use and eventual disposition to its carrying value. We calculate the amount of impairment loss as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Historically, changes in market conditions and management strategy have caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long-lived assets.

*Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions*

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, with the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of acquired net tangible assets and identified intangible assets considered goodwill. As a result, we disclose goodwill separately from other intangible assets. Other identifiable intangibles include customer relationships, patented and other developed technology, and trade names and trademarks.

[Summary: This excerpt contains information on impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as details on the valuation techniques used, assumptions made, and the process for recognizing impairment losses, along with information on foreign currency translation and financial instruments hedging strategies.]

Table of Contents

We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter and, as necessary, if changes in facts and circumstances that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. Factors that may cause us to perform an impairment test outside of our annual assessment include significant underperformance of a business relative to expected operating results, significant adverse economic and industry trends, significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value, or our decision to divest a portion of a reporting unit. In performing impairment tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. A quantitative assessment primarily uses the present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of reporting units with goodwill.

We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the unit’s fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.

In consultation with outside specialists, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions, including a reporting unit's respective forecasted sales, operating margins and growth rates, as well as discount rates. Our assumptions about discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies. Our assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and marketplace data. We also make assumptions for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond our long-term business plan period. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. However, actual future results may differ materially from these estimates and projections. The valuation methodology we use to estimate the fair value of reporting units requires inputs and assumptions that reflect current market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies that require management judgment. The estimated fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions.

We test indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trade names and trademarks, for impairment in the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that their carrying amounts exceed their fair values. In performing the impairment tests, we have the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment. If we decide not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. Fair value is estimated as the discounted value of future revenues using a royalty rate that a third party would pay to use the asset. Variation in the royalty rates could impact our estimate of fair value. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We amortize finite-lived intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, patented and other developed technology, trade names and trademarks, and other intangibles, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

See Note 3, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions,” for more information.

*Foreign Currency*

We translate asset and liability accounts of international operations into U.S. dollars at current rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average currency rate for the fiscal year. We record gains and losses resulting from hedging the value of investments in certain international operations and from the translation of balance sheet accounts directly as a component of other comprehensive income.

We account for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary because the country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. As a result, the functional currency of our Argentine subsidiary is the U.S. dollar.

*Financial Instruments*

We enter into foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations associated with receivables, payables, loans and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies that arise primarily as a result of our operations outside the U.S. From time to time, we enter into interest rate contracts to help manage our exposure to certain interest rate fluctuations. We also enter into futures contracts to hedge certain price fluctuations for a portion of our anticipated domestic purchases of natural gas. The maximum length of time for which we hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 36 months for forecasted foreign currency exchange and commodity transactions and 10 years for cross-currency swap transactions.

On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we determine whether the derivative will be designated as a hedge. Other derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Our policy is not to purchase or hold any foreign currency, interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.

[Summary: This excerpt contains information regarding the accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments, including fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and net investment hedges, as well as details on fair value measurements and revenue recognition practices in the company's 10-K filing.]

Table of Contents

All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and is highly effective, as well as the nature of the hedging activity. We formally document all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges, the hedged item, the method for assessing effectiveness and the treatment of excluded components. These financial instruments can be designated as:

•Fair value hedges - Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability. The gain or loss from the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of the change in fair value. Hedge effectiveness is based on the spot method and expected to be perfectly effective. Excluded components are not included in the effectiveness assessment, recognized in a systematic and rational method over the term of the contracts and recorded to the same income statement line as the item being hedged.

•Cash flow hedges - Hedges to reduce the variability of future expected cash flows. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings. Gains and losses on these derivatives, representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in current earnings.

•Net investment hedges - Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized as foreign currency translation in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" until the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Hedge effectiveness is based on the spot method, with no ineffectiveness expected over the duration of the hedging relationship. Excluded components are not included in the effectiveness assessment, recorded in a systematic and rational basis over the term of the contracts and recorded to “Marketing, general and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

We assess, both at the inception of any hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether our hedges are highly effective. If we determine that a hedge is not highly effective, we prospectively discontinue hedge accounting. For cash flow hedges, we record gains and losses as components of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. In the event that the anticipated transaction is no longer highly probable to occur, we recognize the change in fair value of the hedging instrument in current period earnings. We recognize changes in fair value hedges in current period earnings. We also recognize changes in the fair value of underlying hedged items (such as recognized assets or liabilities) in current period earnings and offset the changes in the fair value of the derivative.

In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, hedges are classified in the same category as the hedged item.

See Note 5, “Financial Instruments,” for more information.

*Fair Value Measurements*

We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid for transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

We determine fair value based on a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which we use to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers consist of Level 1, which are observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, which are unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, requiring us to develop our own assumptions to determine the best estimate of fair value.

*Revenue Recognition*

Substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of products. Our Materials Group reportable segment sells pressure-sensitive label materials, films, performance tapes and fasteners. Our Solutions Group reportable segment sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions-oriented products, such as tickets, tags, labels (including RFID inlays), as well as related equipment, services and supplies, that provide our customers with solutions to optimize branding and engagement with their consumers and enable item visibility and traceability. We recognize revenue for an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect from the sale of our products when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of our products to a customer. We consider a number of factors in determining when we have transferred control to a customer, including the following: (i) our present right to payment; (ii) the customer’s legal title to the asset; (iii) physical possession of the asset; (iv) the customer’s significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset; and (v) the customer’s acceptance of the asset. Generally, there are no substantive differences in revenue recognition considerations among our various products. Control generally transfers to a customer upon shipment or delivery, depending on the specific terms of sale with the customer.

[Summary: This section of the document outlines the business acquisitions made by the company in the years 2022 and 2023, providing details on the acquired companies, the purchase considerations, and the impact on the company's product portfolio within its Solutions Group reportable segment.]

### NOTE 2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

*2023 Business Acquisitions*

On November 23, 2023, we completed our business acquisition of Silver Crystal Group ("Silver Crystal"), a Canada-based provider of sports apparel customization and application solutions across in-venue, direct-to-business and e-commerce platforms. On May 22, 2023, we completed our business acquisition of LG Group, Inc. ("Lion Brothers"), a Maryland-based designer and manufacturer of apparel brand embellishments. On March 6, 2023, we completed our business acquisition of Thermopatch, Inc. ("Thermopatch"), a New York-based manufacturer specializing in labeling, embellishments and transfers for the sports, industrial laundry, workwear and hospitality industries. These acquisitions expanded the product portfolio in our Solutions Group reportable segment.

The acquisitions of Silver Crystal, Lion Brothers and Thermopatch are referred to collectively as the "2023 Acquisitions."

The aggregate purchase consideration, including purchase consideration payable, for the 2023 Acquisitions was approximately $231 million. We funded the 2023 Acquisitions using cash and commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the cash paid at closing, the sellers in one of these acquisitions are eligible for earn-out payments of up to $5 million, subject to the acquired company achieving certain post-acquisition performance targets. As of the acquisition date, we included an estimate of the fair value of these earn-out payments in the aggregate purchase consideration.

The 2023 Acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

*2022 Business Acquisitions*

In January 2022, we completed our business acquisitions of TexTrace AG ("TexTrace"), a Switzerland-based technology developer specializing in custom-made woven and knitted RFID products that can be sewn onto or inserted into garments, and Rietveld Serigrafie B.V. and Rietveld Screenprinting Serigrafi Baski Matbaa Tekstil Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (collectively, "Rietveld"), a Netherlands-based provider of external embellishment solutions and application and printing methods for performance brands and team sports in Europe. These acquisitions expanded the product portfolio in our Solutions Group reportable segment. The acquisitions of TexTrace and Rietveld are referred to collectively as the "2022 Acquisitions."

The aggregate purchase consideration for the 2022 Acquisitions was approximately $35 million. We funded the 2022 Acquisitions using cash and commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the cash paid at closing, the sellers in one of these acquisitions are eligible for earn-out payments of up to $30 million, subject to the acquired company achieving certain post-acquisition performance targets. As of the acquisition date, we included an estimate of the fair value of these earn-out payments in the aggregate purchase consideration.

The 2022 Acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

[Summary: This excerpt contains information on goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and finite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, including impairment tests, changes in the carrying amounts of assets, and the fair value estimation methodology used for acquired intangibles.]

### NOTE 3. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES RESULTING FROM BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

*Goodwill*

Results from our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024 indicated that no impairment occurred during 2024. The assumptions used in our assessment were primarily based on Level 3 inputs.

Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for 2024 and 2023 by reportable segment are shown below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **Materials Group** | | **Solutions Group** | | **Total** | |
| Goodwill as of December 31, 2022 | $ | 618.7 | $ | 1,243.7 | $ | 1,862.4 |
| Acquisitions(1) | — | | 135.0 | | 135.0 | |
| Translation adjustments | 12.0 | | 4.2 | | 16.2 | |
| Goodwill as of December 30, 2023 | 630.7 | | 1,382.9 | | 2,013.6 | |
| Acquisition adjustments(2) | — | | (2.7) | | (2.7) | |
| Translation adjustments | (24.6) | | (10.1) | | (34.7) | |
| Goodwill as of December 28, 2024 | $ | 606.1 | $ | 1,370.1 | $ | 1,976.2 |

(1)Goodwill acquired related to the 2023 Acquisitions. We expect substantially all of the recognized goodwill related to the 2023 Acquisitions not to be deductible for income tax purposes.

(2)Measurement period adjustments related to the finalization of the purchase price allocation for our 2023 Acquisitions.

The carrying amounts of goodwill at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were net of accumulated impairment losses of $820 million recognized in fiscal year 2009 by our Solutions Group reportable segment.

*Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets*

Results from our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test in the fourth quarter indicated that no impairment occurred in 2024. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, consisting of trade names and trademarks, was $154.5 million and $155.3 million at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

*Finite-Lived Intangible Assets*

In connection with the 2023 Acquisitions, we acquired approximately $94 million of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets, which consisted of customer relationships, patented and other developed technology, and trade names and trademarks. We utilized the income approach to estimate the fair value of acquired identifiable intangibles, primarily using Level 3 inputs. We applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of intangible assets, which included our estimates and assumptions with respect to estimated future revenue and related profit margins, customer retention rates, technology migration curves, royalty rates, discount rates and economic lives assigned to the acquired intangible assets.

The table below summarizes the amounts and weighted average useful lives of the intangible assets associated with the 2023 Acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Amount(in millions)** | | **Weighted averageamortizationperiod(in years)** |
| Customer relationships | $ | 68.8 | 11 |

[Summary: This excerpt contains information on the company's debt structure, including short-term borrowings, credit facilities, and long-term borrowings, detailing specific amounts, terms, and interest rates for various debt instruments and programs.]

### NOTE 4. DEBT

*Short-Term Borrowings*

We had no outstanding borrowings from U.S. commercial paper as of December 28, 2024 and $112 million of outstanding borrowings from U.S. commercial paper issuances as of December 30, 2023 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.54%.

We have a Euro-Commercial Paper Program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500 million. Proceeds from issuances under this program may be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the notes vary, but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issuance. Our payment obligations with respect to any notes issued under this program are backed by our revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”). There are no financial covenants under this program. We had no outstanding balance as of December 28, 2024 and $199.2 million outstanding under this program as of December 30, 2023 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.13%.

*Short-Term Credit Facilities*

In June 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") related to the Revolver to borrow up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion through its maturity date of June 26, 2029. The Revolver refinanced the prior revolving credit facility under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 13, 2020, as amended. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the commitments under the Revolver may be increased by up to $600 million, subject to lender approvals and customary requirements. Under certain circumstances, we may request that the commitments under the Revolver be extended for one-year periods in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. We use the Revolver as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program and for other corporate purposes.

No balance was outstanding under the Revolver as of December 28, 2024 or our prior revolving credit facility as of December 30, 2023. Commitment fees associated with revolving credit facilities in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $1.5 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

In addition to the Revolver, we have short-term lines of credit available in various countries of approximately $261 million in the aggregate at December 28, 2024. These lines may be cancelled at any time by us or the issuing banks. Borrowings under our short-term lines of credit were not material as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.

From time to time, we provide guarantees on certain arrangements with banks. Our exposure to these guarantees is not material.

*Long-Term Borrowings*

In November 2024, we issued €500 million of senior notes, due November 4, 2034, which bear an interest rate of 3.750% per year, payable annually in arrears. Our net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately €495 million ($539 million), which we intend to use to repay our €500 million of senior notes maturing in March 2025 and for general corporate purposes.

In August 2024, we repaid our $300 million of senior notes at maturity using cash flows from operations and commercial paper borrowings.

During 2024, we reclassified our $5 million of medium-term notes due in the third quarter of 2025, $25 million of medium-term notes due in the second quarter of 2025 and €500 million of senior notes due in the first quarter of 2025 from "Long-term debt and finance leases" to "Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt and finance leases" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In March 2023, we issued $400 million of senior notes, due March 15, 2033, which bear an interest rate of 5.750% per year, payable semiannually in arrears. Our net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $394.9 million, which we used to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper programs and our $250 million of senior notes that matured on April 15, 2023.

(1) These senior notes are euro-denominated. The senior notes due in 2025 and 2034 each have a face value of €500 million.

(2) Included unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts of $12.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, as of year-end 2024 and $11.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as of year-end 2023.

At year-end 2024 and 2023, our medium-term notes had accrued interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 7.5%.

We expect maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter to be as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Year** | **(In millions)** | |
| 2025 | $ | 551.2 |

| 2029 | — | |
| 2030 and thereafter | 2,071.2 | |

Refer to Note 7, “Commitments and Leases,” for information related to finance leases.

*Other*

The Revolver contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a specified ratio of total debt minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50 million to a certain measure of income. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

Our total interest costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $124.0 million, $126.5 million and $89.8 million, respectively, of which $7.0 million, $7.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, was capitalized as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment, capitalized software and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements.

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is primarily based on the credit spread above U.S. Treasury securities or euro government bond securities, as applicable, on notes with similar rates, credit ratings and remaining maturities. The fair value of short-term borrowings, which includes commercial paper issuances and short-term lines of credit, approximates their carrying value given their short duration. The fair value of our total debt was $3.01 billion at December 28, 2024 and $3.11 billion at December 30, 2023. Fair value amounts were determined based primarily on Level 2 inputs. Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for more information.

[Summary: This section of the document contains information about the company's use of derivative financial instruments, including fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, net investment hedges, and other derivatives, to manage risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates.]

### NOTE 5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We use various derivative financial instruments to manage risks in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. We recognize derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

*Fair Value Hedges*

During 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our €500 million of senior notes due in the first quarter of 2025 and €500 million of senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2034 to offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to foreign currency risk. The foreign currency forward contracts hedging our €500 million of senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2034 have a maturity date of December 2025.

*Cash Flow Hedges*

During 2020, we entered into U.S. dollar to euro cross-currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $250 million to effectively convert our fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt into euro-denominated debt, including semiannual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity. During the term of the contract, which ends on April 30, 2030, we pay fixed-rate interest in euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. dollars.

We designate commodity forward contracts on forecasted purchases of commodities as cash flow hedges.

During 2024, we entered into interest rate forward-starting swap contracts that we designated as cash flow hedges that were terminated upon the issuance of our €500 million of senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2034. The resulting gain will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the hedged fixed-rate interest payments.

*Net Investment Hedges*

During 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts and zero-cost collars, combining each pair as net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The objective of the hedging activity is to minimize the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in certain foreign operations between the sold put strike and the purchased call strike rates of the contracts. The notional amount of these hedges are approximately €420 million and €500 million with maturity dates in March 2025 and December 2025, respectively.

*Other Derivatives*

Our outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts as of December 28, 2024 were recorded in various currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling and Hong Kong dollar. For other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings.

[Summary: This section of the filing discusses the company's defined benefit plans, including information on plan assets, fair value measurements, and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits.]

### NOTE 6. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

*Defined Benefit Plans*

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans, the accrual of benefits under some of which has been frozen, covering eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Benefits payable to an employee are based primarily on years of service and the employee’s compensation during the course of his or her employment with our company.

We are also obligated to pay unfunded termination indemnity benefits to certain employees outside the U.S., which are subject to applicable agreements, laws and regulations. No costs related to these benefits have been included in the disclosures below because they have not been significant.

*Plan Assets*

Assets in our non-U.S. plans are invested in accordance with locally accepted practices and primarily include equity securities, fixed income securities, insurance contracts and cash. Asset allocations and investments vary by country and plan. Our target plan asset investment allocation for our non-U.S. plans in the aggregate is approximately 25% in equity securities, 61% in fixed income securities and cash, and 14% in insurance contracts and other investments, subject to periodic fluctuations among these asset classes.

*Fair Value Measurements*

The valuation methodologies we use for assets measured at fair value are described below.

Cash is valued at nominal value. Cash equivalents and mutual funds are valued at fair value as determined by quoted market prices, based upon the net asset value (“NAV”) of shares held at year-end. Pooled funds are structured as collective trusts, not publicly traded and valued by calculating NAV per unit based on the NAV of the underlying funds/trusts as a practical expedient for the fair value of the pooled funds. The pooled funds are categorized by the investment strategy, which is primarily equity and fixed income securities. The pooled funds categorized as other investments are primarily investments in real estate funds. Insurance contracts are valued at book value, which approximates fair value and is calculated using the prior-year balance plus or minus investment returns and changes in cash flows.

These methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe these valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

[Summary: This document contains information related to pension plan assumptions, discount rates, long-term return on assets, measurement date, and plan balance sheet reconciliations. The purpose is to explain how discount rates and long-term asset return assumptions are determined, as well as provide a reconciliation of benefit obligations for defined benefit plans.]

Table of Contents

*Plan Assumptions*

*Discount Rate*

In consultation with our actuaries, we annually review and determine the discount rates used to value our pension and other postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. Our discount rate is determined by evaluating yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans.

We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under this approach, we apply multiple discount rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. We believe that this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest cost by aligning the timing of a plan’s liability cash flows to its corresponding rates on the yield curve.

*Long-term Return on Assets*

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into account our asset allocation, the correlation between returns in our asset classes, and our mix of active and passive investments. Additionally, we evaluate current market conditions, including interest rates, and review market data for reasonableness and appropriateness.

*Measurement Date*

We measure the actuarial value of our benefit obligations and plan assets using the calendar month-end closest to our fiscal year-end and adjust for any contributions or other significant events between the measurement date and our fiscal year-end.

*Plan Balance Sheet Reconciliations*

The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status of the plans and accumulated other comprehensive loss for our defined benefit plans:

*Plan Contributions*

We make contributions to our defined benefit plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable laws and regulations, plus additional amounts, if any, we determine to be appropriate. The following table sets forth our expected contributions in 2025:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 2029 | 4.7 | | 26.6 | |
| 2030-2034 | 17.0 | | 152.5 | |

*Postretirement Health Benefits*

We provide postretirement health benefits to certain of our retired U.S. employees up to the age of 65 under a cost-sharing arrangement and provide supplemental Medicare benefits to certain of our U.S. retirees over the age of 65. Our postretirement health benefit plan was closed to new participants retiring after December 31, 2021. Our policy is to fund the cost of these postretirement benefits from operating cash flows. While we do not intend to terminate these postretirement health benefits, we may do so at any time, subject to applicable laws and regulations. At year-end 2024, our postretirement health benefits obligation and related loss recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” were approximately $2 million and $9 million, respectively. At year-end 2023, our postretirement health benefits obligation and related loss recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” were approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit cost was not material in 2024, 2023 or 2022.

*Defined Contribution Plans*

We sponsor various defined contribution plans worldwide, the largest of which is the Avery Dennison Corporation Employee Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”), a 401(k) plan for our U.S. employees.

We recognized expense of $31.9 million, $30.3 million and $27.3 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to our employer contributions and employer match of participant contributions to the Savings Plan.

*Other Retirement Plans*

We have deferred compensation plans and programs that permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. The compensation voluntarily deferred by the participant, together with certain employer contributions, earns specified and variable rates of return. As of year-end 2024 and 2023, we had accrued $99.0 million and $88.2 million, respectively, for our obligations under these plans. A portion of the interest on certain of our contributions may be forfeited by participants if their employment terminates before age 55 other than by reason of death or disability.

Our Directors Deferred Equity Compensation Program allows our non-employee directors to elect to receive their cash compensation in deferred stock units (“DSUs”) issued under our equity plan. Additionally, two legacy deferred compensation plans had DSUs that were issued under our then-active equity plans. Dividend equivalents, representing the value of dividends per share paid on shares of our common stock and calculated with reference to the number of DSUs held as of a quarterly dividend record date, are credited in the form of additional DSUs on the applicable dividend payable date. DSUs are converted into shares of our common stock, less fractional shares, and issued to a participating director upon his or her separation from our Board. Approximately 0.04 million and 0.1 million DSUs were outstanding as of year-end 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an aggregate value of $8 million and $19 million, respectively.

### NOTE 15. SEGMENT AND DISAGGREGATED REVENUE INFORMATION

*Segment Reporting*

We have the following reportable segments:

•Materials Group – manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive label materials, films for graphic and reflective products, performance tapes and other adhesive products for industrial, medical and other applications, as well as fastener solutions.

•Solutions Group – designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions, including brand and price tickets, tags and labels (including RFID inlays), and related services, supplies and equipment.

Our President and Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and is responsible for the allocation of resources and evaluation of performance of our reportable segments. The CODM's oversight includes establishing performance targets to advance our long-term strategy and increase stockholder value, allocating capital to our reportable segments to achieve those targets, developing compensation programs to incentivize segment leaders to achieve those targets, and analyzing key performance metrics to track progress against those targets. The CODM reviews the performance of each segment by comparing each reportable segment’s current period results with its annual operating plan targets, its most recent quarterly forecast, and the prior year to assess how segment results impacted our company’s overall results.

*Disaggregated Revenue Information*

Disaggregated revenue information is shown below in the manner that best reflects how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

*Additional Segment Information*

Additional financial information by reportable segment is shown below.

Intersegment sales are recorded at or near market prices and are eliminated in determining consolidated net sales. We do not disclose total assets by reportable segment since we neither generate nor review that information internally. As our reporting structure is neither organized nor reviewed internally by country, results by individual country are not provided.
