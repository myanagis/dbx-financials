**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

### NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

*Nature of Operations*

We are a global materials science and digital identification solutions company. We are Making PossibleTM products and solutions that help advance the industries we serve, providing branding and information solutions that optimize labor and supply chain efficiency, reduce waste, advance sustainability, circularity and transparency, and better connect brands and consumers. We design and develop labeling and functional materials, radio-frequency identification ("RFID") inlays and tags, software applications that connect the physical and digital, and offerings that enhance branded packaging and carry or display information that improves the customer experience. We serve an array of industries worldwide, including home and personal care, apparel, general retail, e-commerce, logistics, food and grocery, pharmaceuticals and automotive.

*Principles of Consolidation*

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

*Fiscal Year*

Our fiscal years have generally consisted of 52 weeks, with every fifth or sixth fiscal year consisting of 53 weeks; our 2024, 2023 and 2022 fiscal years consisted of 52-week periods ending December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Subsequent to fiscal year-end 2024, in January 2025, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors approved a change to our previous 52- or 53-week fiscal year generally ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 to a fiscal year coincident with the calendar year. Our 2025 fiscal year that began on December 29, 2024 will end on December 31, 2025 and fiscal years 2026 and beyond will begin on January 1 and end on December 31.

*Accounting Guidance Updates*

*Segment Disclosures*

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we adopted guidance that requires additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. See Note 15, “Segment and Disaggregated Revenue Information,” for more information.

*Use of Estimates*

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the date of our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. As the effects of future events cannot be determined, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.

*Cash and Cash Equivalents*

Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash on hand, deposits in banks, cash-in-transit, and bank drafts and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased or received. The carrying value of these assets approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

*Inventories*

We state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value and categorize them as raw materials, work-in-progress or finished goods. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. We record inventory that is damaged, obsolete, excess and slow-moving to cost of products sold and establish a lower cost basis for that inventory. Slow-moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be recognized partially or fully to cost of products sold depending on the type of product, level of usage and length of time the product has been included in inventory.

*Trade Accounts Receivable*

We record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount. Our allowances for credit losses reflect customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable values. We record these allowances based on estimates related to the financial

condition of customers; the aging of receivable balances; our historical collection experience; and current and expected future macroeconomic and market conditions.

*Property, Plant and Equipment*

We generally compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, ranging from ten to 45 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the term of the associated lease. We expense maintenance and repair costs as incurred; we capitalize renewals and improvements. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the accounts are relieved of the cost and the related accumulated depreciation, with any resulting gain or loss included in net income.

*Leases*

Our leases primarily relate to office and warehouse space, machinery, transportation, and equipment for information technology. We determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. For lease accounting purposes, we do not separate lease and nonlease components, nor do we record operating or finance lease assets and liabilities for short-term leases. We have options to renew or terminate some of our leases. We evaluate renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date and over the lease term to determine if we are reasonably certain to exercise these options. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. We recognize expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with variable lease payments recognized in the periods in which they are incurred.

*Software*

We capitalize software costs incurred during the application development stage of software development, including costs incurred for design, coding, installation to hardware, testing, and upgrades and enhancements that provide the software or hardware with additional functionalities and capabilities. We expense software costs, including internal and external training costs and maintenance costs, incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation and/or operation stage. Capitalized software, which is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally between five and ten years.

*Cloud Computing Arrangements*

We capitalize certain costs incurred during the application development stage of implementation under a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. We expense costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post-implementation and/or operation stage. Capitalized implementation costs, which are included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting arrangement plus optional renewal periods, which is generally between five and ten years.

*Venture Investments*

We primarily invest in privately held companies and utilize the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, measuring them at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in an orderly transaction. Venture investments that are publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The carrying value of our venture investments is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 9, “Fair Value Measurements,” for more information.

*Impairment of Long-lived Assets*

We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are determined not to be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected from the applicable asset or asset group’s use and eventual disposition to its carrying value. We calculate the amount of impairment loss as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Historically, changes in market conditions and management strategy have caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our long-lived assets.

*Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions*

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, with the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of acquired net tangible assets and identified intangible assets considered goodwill. As a result, we disclose goodwill separately from other intangible assets. Other identifiable intangibles include customer relationships, patented and other developed technology, and trade names and trademarks.

Table of Contents

We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter and, as necessary, if changes in facts and circumstances that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. Factors that may cause us to perform an impairment test outside of our annual assessment include significant underperformance of a business relative to expected operating results, significant adverse economic and industry trends, significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value, or our decision to divest a portion of a reporting unit. In performing impairment tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. A quantitative assessment primarily uses the present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of reporting units with goodwill.

We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the unit’s fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.

In consultation with outside specialists, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions, including a reporting unit's respective forecasted sales, operating margins and growth rates, as well as discount rates. Our assumptions about discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies. Our assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and marketplace data. We also make assumptions for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond our long-term business plan period. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. However, actual future results may differ materially from these estimates and projections. The valuation methodology we use to estimate the fair value of reporting units requires inputs and assumptions that reflect current market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies that require management judgment. The estimated fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions.

We test indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trade names and trademarks, for impairment in the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that their carrying amounts exceed their fair values. In performing the impairment tests, we have the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment. If we decide not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. Fair value is estimated as the discounted value of future revenues using a royalty rate that a third party would pay to use the asset. Variation in the royalty rates could impact our estimate of fair value. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We amortize finite-lived intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, patented and other developed technology, trade names and trademarks, and other intangibles, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

See Note 3, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions,” for more information.

*Foreign Currency*

We translate asset and liability accounts of international operations into U.S. dollars at current rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average currency rate for the fiscal year. We record gains and losses resulting from hedging the value of investments in certain international operations and from the translation of balance sheet accounts directly as a component of other comprehensive income.

We account for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary because the country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. As a result, the functional currency of our Argentine subsidiary is the U.S. dollar.

*Financial Instruments*

We enter into foreign currency exchange derivative contracts to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations associated with receivables, payables, loans and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies that arise primarily as a result of our operations outside the U.S. From time to time, we enter into interest rate contracts to help manage our exposure to certain interest rate fluctuations. We also enter into futures contracts to hedge certain price fluctuations for a portion of our anticipated domestic purchases of natural gas. The maximum length of time for which we hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 36 months for forecasted foreign currency exchange and commodity transactions and 10 years for cross-currency swap transactions.

On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we determine whether the derivative will be designated as a hedge. Other derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Our policy is not to purchase or hold any foreign currency, interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.

Table of Contents

All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and is highly effective, as well as the nature of the hedging activity. We formally document all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges, the hedged item, the method for assessing effectiveness and the treatment of excluded components. These financial instruments can be designated as:

•Fair value hedges - Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability. The gain or loss from the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of the change in fair value. Hedge effectiveness is based on the spot method and expected to be perfectly effective. Excluded components are not included in the effectiveness assessment, recognized in a systematic and rational method over the term of the contracts and recorded to the same income statement line as the item being hedged.

•Cash flow hedges - Hedges to reduce the variability of future expected cash flows. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings. Gains and losses on these derivatives, representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in current earnings.

•Net investment hedges - Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation. The gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized as foreign currency translation in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" until the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Hedge effectiveness is based on the spot method, with no ineffectiveness expected over the duration of the hedging relationship. Excluded components are not included in the effectiveness assessment, recorded in a systematic and rational basis over the term of the contracts and recorded to “Marketing, general and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

We assess, both at the inception of any hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether our hedges are highly effective. If we determine that a hedge is not highly effective, we prospectively discontinue hedge accounting. For cash flow hedges, we record gains and losses as components of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. In the event that the anticipated transaction is no longer highly probable to occur, we recognize the change in fair value of the hedging instrument in current period earnings. We recognize changes in fair value hedges in current period earnings. We also recognize changes in the fair value of underlying hedged items (such as recognized assets or liabilities) in current period earnings and offset the changes in the fair value of the derivative.

In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, hedges are classified in the same category as the hedged item.

See Note 5, “Financial Instruments,” for more information.

*Fair Value Measurements*

We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid for transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

We determine fair value based on a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which we use to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers consist of Level 1, which are observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, which are unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, requiring us to develop our own assumptions to determine the best estimate of fair value.

*Revenue Recognition*

Substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of products. Our Materials Group reportable segment sells pressure-sensitive label materials, films, performance tapes and fasteners. Our Solutions Group reportable segment sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions-oriented products, such as tickets, tags, labels (including RFID inlays), as well as related equipment, services and supplies, that provide our customers with solutions to optimize branding and engagement with their consumers and enable item visibility and traceability. We recognize revenue for an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect from the sale of our products when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of our products to a customer. We consider a number of factors in determining when we have transferred control to a customer, including the following: (i) our present right to payment; (ii) the customer’s legal title to the asset; (iii) physical possession of the asset; (iv) the customer’s significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset; and (v) the customer’s acceptance of the asset. Generally, there are no substantive differences in revenue recognition considerations among our various products. Control generally transfers to a customer upon shipment or delivery, depending on the specific terms of sale with the customer.

Table of Contents

Our payment terms with customers are generally consistent with those used in the industries and regions in which we operate.

We accept sales returns in certain limited circumstances. We record a liability for estimated returns and a corresponding reduction to sales in the amount we expect to repay or credit customers, which we base on historical returns and outstanding customer claims. We update our estimates each reporting period.

Sales rebates, discounts and other customer concessions represent variable consideration and are common in the industries and regions in which we operate, which we account for as a reduction to sales based on estimates at the time at which products are sold. We base these estimates on our historical experience, as well as current information such as sales forecasts. We regularly review our estimates and adjust the revenue recognized from sales as necessary as additional information becomes available.

We exclude sales tax, value-added tax and other taxes we collect from customers from sales. We account for shipping and handling activities after control of a product is transferred to a customer as fulfillment costs and not as separate performance obligations. As a practical expedient, we have elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of less than one year. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because their expected amortization period is one year or less. We record these costs in “Marketing, general and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

*Research and Development*

Research and development costs are related to research, design and testing of new products and applications, which we expense as incurred.

*Long-Term Incentive Compensation*

No long-term incentive compensation expense was capitalized in 2024, 2023 or 2022.

*Valuation of Stock-Based Awards*

We base our stock-based compensation expense on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). We base compensation expense for performance units (“PUs”) on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and amortized on a straight-line basis as these awards cliff-vest at the end of the requisite service period. We base compensation expense related to market-leveraged stock units (“MSUs”) on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and amortized on a graded-vesting basis over their respective performance periods.

Compensation expense for awards with a market condition as a performance objective, which includes MSUs and a component of PUs, is not adjusted if the condition is not met, as long as the requisite service period is met.

We estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected option term.

We determine the fair value of RSUs and the component of PUs that is subject to the achievement of a performance objective using a financial performance condition based on the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for foregone dividends. Over the performance period of the PUs, the estimated number of shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting is adjusted upward or downward from the target shares at the time of grant based on the probability of the performance objectives established for the award being achieved.

We determine the fair value of stock-based awards that are subject to the achievement of performance objectives based on a market condition, which includes MSUs and the other component of PUs, using the Monte-Carlo simulation method, which utilizes multiple input variables, including expected stock price volatility and other assumptions appropriate for determining fair value, to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance objectives established for the award.

Certain of these assumptions are based on management’s estimates, in consultation with outside specialists. Significant changes in assumptions for future awards and actual forfeiture rates could materially impact stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.

*Valuation of Cash-Based Awards*

Cash-based awards consist of long-term incentive units (“LTI Units”) granted to eligible employees. We classify LTI Units as liability awards and remeasure them at each quarter-end over the applicable vesting or performance period. In addition to LTI Units with terms and conditions that mirror those of RSUs, we also grant certain employees LTI Units with terms and conditions that mirror those of PUs and MSUs.

Table of Contents

*Forfeitures*

We estimate expected forfeitures in determining the compensation cost to be recognized each period, rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur. We record changes in estimated forfeiture rates as cumulative adjustments in the period estimates are revised.

See Note 12, “Long-term Incentive Compensation,” for more information.

*Taxes Based on Income*

Because we are subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision for income taxes, accruals for taxes, deferred taxes and tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with GAAP. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. We recognize and measure our uncertain tax positions following the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition and measurement for tax positions we take or expect to take on a tax return.

See Note 14, “Taxes Based on Income,” for more information.

*Recent Accounting Requirements*

In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance expanding the disclosure requirements for certain expenses in notes to consolidated financial statements. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on our financial statement disclosures.

### NOTE 2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

*2023 Business Acquisitions*

On November 23, 2023, we completed our business acquisition of Silver Crystal Group ("Silver Crystal"), a Canada-based provider of sports apparel customization and application solutions across in-venue, direct-to-business and e-commerce platforms. On May 22, 2023, we completed our business acquisition of LG Group, Inc. ("Lion Brothers"), a Maryland-based designer and manufacturer of apparel brand embellishments. On March 6, 2023, we completed our business acquisition of Thermopatch, Inc. ("Thermopatch"), a New York-based manufacturer specializing in labeling, embellishments and transfers for the sports, industrial laundry, workwear and hospitality industries. These acquisitions expanded the product portfolio in our Solutions Group reportable segment.

The acquisitions of Silver Crystal, Lion Brothers and Thermopatch are referred to collectively as the "2023 Acquisitions."

The aggregate purchase consideration, including purchase consideration payable, for the 2023 Acquisitions was approximately $231 million. We funded the 2023 Acquisitions using cash and commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the cash paid at closing, the sellers in one of these acquisitions are eligible for earn-out payments of up to $5 million, subject to the acquired company achieving certain post-acquisition performance targets. As of the acquisition date, we included an estimate of the fair value of these earn-out payments in the aggregate purchase consideration.

The 2023 Acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

*2022 Business Acquisitions*

In January 2022, we completed our business acquisitions of TexTrace AG ("TexTrace"), a Switzerland-based technology developer specializing in custom-made woven and knitted RFID products that can be sewn onto or inserted into garments, and Rietveld Serigrafie B.V. and Rietveld Screenprinting Serigrafi Baski Matbaa Tekstil Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi (collectively, "Rietveld"), a Netherlands-based provider of external embellishment solutions and application and printing methods for performance brands and team sports in Europe. These acquisitions expanded the product portfolio in our Solutions Group reportable segment. The acquisitions of TexTrace and Rietveld are referred to collectively as the "2022 Acquisitions."

The aggregate purchase consideration for the 2022 Acquisitions was approximately $35 million. We funded the 2022 Acquisitions using cash and commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the cash paid at closing, the sellers in one of these acquisitions are eligible for earn-out payments of up to $30 million, subject to the acquired company achieving certain post-acquisition performance targets. As of the acquisition date, we included an estimate of the fair value of these earn-out payments in the aggregate purchase consideration.

The 2022 Acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

### NOTE 3. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES RESULTING FROM BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

*Goodwill*

Results from our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024 indicated that no impairment occurred during 2024. The assumptions used in our assessment were primarily based on Level 3 inputs.

Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for 2024 and 2023 by reportable segment are shown below.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **Materials Group** | | **Solutions Group** | | **Total** | |
| Goodwill as of December 31, 2022 | $ | 618.7 | $ | 1,243.7 | $ | 1,862.4 |
| Acquisitions(1) | — | | 135.0 | | 135.0 | |
| Translation adjustments | 12.0 | | 4.2 | | 16.2 | |
| Goodwill as of December 30, 2023 | 630.7 | | 1,382.9 | | 2,013.6 | |
| Acquisition adjustments(2) | — | | (2.7) | | (2.7) | |
| Translation adjustments | (24.6) | | (10.1) | | (34.7) | |
| Goodwill as of December 28, 2024 | $ | 606.1 | $ | 1,370.1 | $ | 1,976.2 |

(1)Goodwill acquired related to the 2023 Acquisitions. We expect substantially all of the recognized goodwill related to the 2023 Acquisitions not to be deductible for income tax purposes.

(2)Measurement period adjustments related to the finalization of the purchase price allocation for our 2023 Acquisitions.

The carrying amounts of goodwill at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were net of accumulated impairment losses of $820 million recognized in fiscal year 2009 by our Solutions Group reportable segment.

*Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets*

Results from our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test in the fourth quarter indicated that no impairment occurred in 2024. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, consisting of trade names and trademarks, was $154.5 million and $155.3 million at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

*Finite-Lived Intangible Assets*

In connection with the 2023 Acquisitions, we acquired approximately $94 million of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets, which consisted of customer relationships, patented and other developed technology, and trade names and trademarks. We utilized the income approach to estimate the fair value of acquired identifiable intangibles, primarily using Level 3 inputs. We applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of intangible assets, which included our estimates and assumptions with respect to estimated future revenue and related profit margins, customer retention rates, technology migration curves, royalty rates, discount rates and economic lives assigned to the acquired intangible assets.

The table below summarizes the amounts and weighted average useful lives of the intangible assets associated with the 2023 Acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Amount(in millions)** | | **Weighted averageamortizationperiod(in years)** |
| Customer relationships | $ | 68.8 | 11 |
| Patented and other developed technology | 22.2 | | 7 |
| Trade names and trademarks | 3.0 | | 6 |

| Total | $ | 1,211.5 | $ | 610.7 | $ | 600.8 | $ | 1,221.4 | $ | 527.6 | $ | 693.8 |

Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions was $89.4 million for 2024, $86.3 million for 2023 and $81.8 million for 2022.

We expect estimated amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter to be as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **EstimatedAmortizationExpense** | |
| 2025 | $ | 88.2 |

### NOTE 4. DEBT

*Short-Term Borrowings*

We had no outstanding borrowings from U.S. commercial paper as of December 28, 2024 and $112 million of outstanding borrowings from U.S. commercial paper issuances as of December 30, 2023 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.54%.

We have a Euro-Commercial Paper Program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500 million. Proceeds from issuances under this program may be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the notes vary, but may not exceed 364 days from the date of issuance. Our payment obligations with respect to any notes issued under this program are backed by our revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”). There are no financial covenants under this program. We had no outstanding balance as of December 28, 2024 and $199.2 million outstanding under this program as of December 30, 2023 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.13%.

*Short-Term Credit Facilities*

In June 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") related to the Revolver to borrow up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion through its maturity date of June 26, 2029. The Revolver refinanced the prior revolving credit facility under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 13, 2020, as amended. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the commitments under the Revolver may be increased by up to $600 million, subject to lender approvals and customary requirements. Under certain circumstances, we may request that the commitments under the Revolver be extended for one-year periods in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. We use the Revolver as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program and for other corporate purposes.

No balance was outstanding under the Revolver as of December 28, 2024 or our prior revolving credit facility as of December 30, 2023. Commitment fees associated with revolving credit facilities in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $1.5 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

In addition to the Revolver, we have short-term lines of credit available in various countries of approximately $261 million in the aggregate at December 28, 2024. These lines may be cancelled at any time by us or the issuing banks. Borrowings under our short-term lines of credit were not material as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.

From time to time, we provide guarantees on certain arrangements with banks. Our exposure to these guarantees is not material.

*Long-Term Borrowings*

In November 2024, we issued €500 million of senior notes, due November 4, 2034, which bear an interest rate of 3.750% per year, payable annually in arrears. Our net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately €495 million ($539 million), which we intend to use to repay our €500 million of senior notes maturing in March 2025 and for general corporate purposes.

In August 2024, we repaid our $300 million of senior notes at maturity using cash flows from operations and commercial paper borrowings.

During 2024, we reclassified our $5 million of medium-term notes due in the third quarter of 2025, $25 million of medium-term notes due in the second quarter of 2025 and €500 million of senior notes due in the first quarter of 2025 from "Long-term debt and finance leases" to "Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt and finance leases" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In March 2023, we issued $400 million of senior notes, due March 15, 2033, which bear an interest rate of 5.750% per year, payable semiannually in arrears. Our net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $394.9 million, which we used to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper programs and our $250 million of senior notes that matured on April 15, 2023.

(1) These senior notes are euro-denominated. The senior notes due in 2025 and 2034 each have a face value of €500 million.

(2) Included unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts of $12.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, as of year-end 2024 and $11.3 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as of year-end 2023.

At year-end 2024 and 2023, our medium-term notes had accrued interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 7.5%.

We expect maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter to be as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Year** | **(In millions)** | |
| 2025 | $ | 551.2 |

| 2029 | — | |
| 2030 and thereafter | 2,071.2 | |

Refer to Note 7, “Commitments and Leases,” for information related to finance leases.

*Other*

The Revolver contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a specified ratio of total debt minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50 million to a certain measure of income. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

Our total interest costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $124.0 million, $126.5 million and $89.8 million, respectively, of which $7.0 million, $7.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, was capitalized as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment, capitalized software and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements.

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is primarily based on the credit spread above U.S. Treasury securities or euro government bond securities, as applicable, on notes with similar rates, credit ratings and remaining maturities. The fair value of short-term borrowings, which includes commercial paper issuances and short-term lines of credit, approximates their carrying value given their short duration. The fair value of our total debt was $3.01 billion at December 28, 2024 and $3.11 billion at December 30, 2023. Fair value amounts were determined based primarily on Level 2 inputs. Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for more information.

### NOTE 5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We use various derivative financial instruments to manage risks in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. We recognize derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

*Fair Value Hedges*

During 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our €500 million of senior notes due in the first quarter of 2025 and €500 million of senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2034 to offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to foreign currency risk. The foreign currency forward contracts hedging our €500 million of senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2034 have a maturity date of December 2025.

*Cash Flow Hedges*

During 2020, we entered into U.S. dollar to euro cross-currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $250 million to effectively convert our fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt into euro-denominated debt, including semiannual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity. During the term of the contract, which ends on April 30, 2030, we pay fixed-rate interest in euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. dollars.

We designate commodity forward contracts on forecasted purchases of commodities as cash flow hedges.

During 2024, we entered into interest rate forward-starting swap contracts that we designated as cash flow hedges that were terminated upon the issuance of our €500 million of senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2034. The resulting gain will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the hedged fixed-rate interest payments.

*Net Investment Hedges*

During 2024, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts and zero-cost collars, combining each pair as net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The objective of the hedging activity is to minimize the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on our net investment in certain foreign operations between the sold put strike and the purchased call strike rates of the contracts. The notional amount of these hedges are approximately €420 million and €500 million with maturity dates in March 2025 and December 2025, respectively.

*Other Derivatives*

Our outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts as of December 28, 2024 were recorded in various currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi, British pound sterling and Hong Kong dollar. For other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings.

### NOTE 6. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

*Defined Benefit Plans*

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans, the accrual of benefits under some of which has been frozen, covering eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Benefits payable to an employee are based primarily on years of service and the employee’s compensation during the course of his or her employment with our company.

We are also obligated to pay unfunded termination indemnity benefits to certain employees outside the U.S., which are subject to applicable agreements, laws and regulations. No costs related to these benefits have been included in the disclosures below because they have not been significant.

*Plan Assets*

Assets in our non-U.S. plans are invested in accordance with locally accepted practices and primarily include equity securities, fixed income securities, insurance contracts and cash. Asset allocations and investments vary by country and plan. Our target plan asset investment allocation for our non-U.S. plans in the aggregate is approximately 25% in equity securities, 61% in fixed income securities and cash, and 14% in insurance contracts and other investments, subject to periodic fluctuations among these asset classes.

*Fair Value Measurements*

The valuation methodologies we use for assets measured at fair value are described below.

Cash is valued at nominal value. Cash equivalents and mutual funds are valued at fair value as determined by quoted market prices, based upon the net asset value (“NAV”) of shares held at year-end. Pooled funds are structured as collective trusts, not publicly traded and valued by calculating NAV per unit based on the NAV of the underlying funds/trusts as a practical expedient for the fair value of the pooled funds. The pooled funds are categorized by the investment strategy, which is primarily equity and fixed income securities. The pooled funds categorized as other investments are primarily investments in real estate funds. Insurance contracts are valued at book value, which approximates fair value and is calculated using the prior-year balance plus or minus investment returns and changes in cash flows.

These methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe these valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

*Plan Assumptions*

*Discount Rate*

In consultation with our actuaries, we annually review and determine the discount rates used to value our pension and other postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. Our discount rate is determined by evaluating yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans.

We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under this approach, we apply multiple discount rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. We believe that this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest cost by aligning the timing of a plan’s liability cash flows to its corresponding rates on the yield curve.

*Long-term Return on Assets*

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into account our asset allocation, the correlation between returns in our asset classes, and our mix of active and passive investments. Additionally, we evaluate current market conditions, including interest rates, and review market data for reasonableness and appropriateness.

*Measurement Date*

We measure the actuarial value of our benefit obligations and plan assets using the calendar month-end closest to our fiscal year-end and adjust for any contributions or other significant events between the measurement date and our fiscal year-end.

*Plan Balance Sheet Reconciliations*

The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status of the plans and accumulated other comprehensive loss for our defined benefit plans:

*Postretirement Health Benefits*

We provide postretirement health benefits to certain of our retired U.S. employees up to the age of 65 under a cost-sharing arrangement and provide supplemental Medicare benefits to certain of our U.S. retirees over the age of 65. Our postretirement health benefit plan was closed to new participants retiring after December 31, 2021. Our policy is to fund the cost of these postretirement benefits from operating cash flows. While we do not intend to terminate these postretirement health benefits, we may do so at any time, subject to applicable laws and regulations. At year-end 2024, our postretirement health benefits obligation and related loss recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” were approximately $2 million and $9 million, respectively. At year-end 2023, our postretirement health benefits obligation and related loss recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” were approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively. Net periodic benefit cost was not material in 2024, 2023 or 2022.

*Defined Contribution Plans*

We sponsor various defined contribution plans worldwide, the largest of which is the Avery Dennison Corporation Employee Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”), a 401(k) plan for our U.S. employees.

We recognized expense of $31.9 million, $30.3 million and $27.3 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to our employer contributions and employer match of participant contributions to the Savings Plan.

*Other Retirement Plans*

We have deferred compensation plans and programs that permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. The compensation voluntarily deferred by the participant, together with certain employer contributions, earns specified and variable rates of return. As of year-end 2024 and 2023, we had accrued $99.0 million and $88.2 million, respectively, for our obligations under these plans. A portion of the interest on certain of our contributions may be forfeited by participants if their employment terminates before age 55 other than by reason of death or disability.

Our Directors Deferred Equity Compensation Program allows our non-employee directors to elect to receive their cash compensation in deferred stock units (“DSUs”) issued under our equity plan. Additionally, two legacy deferred compensation plans had DSUs that were issued under our then-active equity plans. Dividend equivalents, representing the value of dividends per share paid on shares of our common stock and calculated with reference to the number of DSUs held as of a quarterly dividend record date, are credited in the form of additional DSUs on the applicable dividend payable date. DSUs are converted into shares of our common stock, less fractional shares, and issued to a participating director upon his or her separation from our Board. Approximately 0.04 million and 0.1 million DSUs were outstanding as of year-end 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an aggregate value of $8 million and $19 million, respectively.

### NOTE 8. CONTINGENCIES

*Legal Proceedings*

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. When it is probable that a loss will be incurred and where a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the best estimate within the range is accrued. When the best estimate within the range cannot be determined, the low end of the range is accrued. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our estimates or should we incur liabilities that were not previously accrued. Probable insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities.

Because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and litigation, future expenses to resolve legal proceedings could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued. If information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued in the range of potential expenses determined to be probable, we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly. Additional lawsuits, claims, inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future. The range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as they arise; until then, a range of potential expenses for their resolution cannot be determined. Based upon current information, we believe that the impact of the resolution of legal proceedings would not be, individually or in the aggregate, material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We were party to a litigation in which ADASA Inc. (“Adasa”), an unrelated third party, alleged that certain of the RFID products within our Solutions Group reportable segment infringed its patent. The case was filed on October 24, 2017 in the United States District Court in the District of Oregon (Eugene Division) and was captioned ADASA Inc. v. Avery Dennison Corporation. We recorded a contingent liability in the amount of $26.6 million related to this matter in the second quarter of 2021 based on a jury verdict issued on May 14, 2021.

We appealed the first instance judgment associated with the jury verdict – which resulted in additional potential liability for the RFID tags sold during the period from the jury verdict to the issuance of the first instance judgment, a higher royalty applicable to tags sold after the judgment and a royalty on additional late-disclosed tags, as well as sanctions, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees, as well as an ongoing royalty on in-scope tags sold after October 14, 2021 – to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “CAFC”). During the fourth quarter of 2022, the CAFC issued its opinion, reversing the grant of summary judgment of validity as to anticipation and obviousness, vacating the sanctions ruling, and remanding the case for retrial with respect to validity for anticipation and obviousness over the prior art. The CAFC affirmed subject-matter eligibility and damages if liability was determined on retrial. On remand, the trial court was required to reconsider the amount of sanctions consistent with the CAFC's instruction to limit sanctions to the late-disclosed tags.

After the U.S. Supreme Court denied our writ of certiorari petition on May 30, 2023, the retrial began on July 10, 2023. On July 18, 2023, the jury in the retrial issued a verdict that Adasa’s patent is valid. We increased our contingent liability to reflect our then-best estimate of the anticipated judgment to $80.4 million as of July 1, 2023, with an expectation to continue adjusting our accrual quarterly, as appropriate. As of December 30, 2023, our contingent liability for this matter was $82.9 million.

On January 25, 2024, the district court issued a revised sanctions order lowering the sanctions against us from approximately $20 million to $5.2 million based on a rate of $0.0025/late-reported tag, which was consistent with the amount we had accrued. In February 2024, the district court issued its decision denying our motion for judgment as a matter of law

and our motion for a new trial. On March 7, 2024, the Court issued an amended final judgment, assessing damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, attorneys' fees, sanctions, and ongoing royalties.

On April 25, 2024, we entered into a Settlement Agreement, License and Mutual Release with Adasa pursuant to which, among other things, (i) we agreed to pay $75.0 million to Adasa without any concessions or admissions of liability; (ii) Adasa agreed to grant us a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable fully-paid up, and ongoing royalty-free perpetual license, without the right to sublicense, to the patents at issue in the litigation; and (iii) the parties mutually released all claims against one another. We paid the agreed-upon settlement amount to Adasa on April 26, 2024. No court approval of the settlement was required; however, as required by the settlement agreement, Adasa filed a Stipulation of Satisfaction of Judgment with the trial court on April 29, 2024.

*Environmental Expenditures*

Environmental expenditures are generally expensed. When it is probable that a loss will be incurred and where a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the best estimate within the range is accrued. When the best estimate within the range cannot be determined, the low end of the range is accrued. The ultimate resolution of these matters could affect future results of operations should our exposure be materially different from our estimates or should we incur liabilities that were not previously accrued. Probable insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities. We review our estimates of the costs of complying with environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of various sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”). However, environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those that extend or improve the economic useful life of existing assets are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the acquired asset or the remaining life of the existing asset.

As of December 28, 2024, we have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and/or other responsible state agencies as a PRP at ten waste disposal or waste recycling sites that are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and/or groundwater contamination. No settlement of our liability related to any of these sites has been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at these sites and anticipate that our share of remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the EPA or other governmental authorities.

These estimates could change as a result of changes in planned remedial actions, remediation technologies, site conditions, the estimated time to complete remediation, environmental laws and regulations, and other factors. Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, our future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued. If information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued in the range of potential expenses, we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly. In addition, we may be identified as a PRP at additional sites in the future. The range of expenses for remediation of any future-identified sites would be addressed as they arise; until then, a range of expenses for their remediation cannot be determined.

The activity related to our environmental liabilities in 2024 and 2023 is shown below:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **2024** | | **2023** | |

| Payments | (13.4) | | (2.3) | |
| Balance at end of year | $ | 13.0 | $ | 24.5 |

Approximately $5 million and $11 million, respectively, of this balance was classified as short-term and included in “Other current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.

Investments included fixed income securities (primarily U.S. government and corporate debt securities) measured at fair value using quoted prices/bids and a money market fund measured at fair value using NAV. As of December 28, 2024, investments of $1.5 million, $38.1 million, and $8.4 million were included in “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Other current assets,” and "Other assets," respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 30, 2023, investments of $2.7 million and $35.1 million were included in “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Other current assets,” respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivatives that are exchange-traded are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Derivatives measured based on foreign currency exchange rate inputs that are readily available in public markets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Bank drafts (maturities greater than three months) are valued at face value due to their short-term nature and were included in “Other current assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contingent consideration liabilities relate to estimated earn-out payments associated with certain acquisitions completed in 2023, 2022 and 2021, which are subject to the acquired companies achieving certain post-acquisition performance targets. These liabilities were recorded based on the expected payments and have been classified as Level 3. Activity related to contingent consideration was immaterial in 2024 and 2023.

In addition to the investments described above, we hold venture investments that had a total carrying value of approximately $45 million and $71 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, which was included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, we began revaluing certain venture investments based on Level 1 inputs; the fair value of these investments was $8.4 million as of December 28, 2024. Related to these investments, we recognized $19.2 million in net losses in 2024, no net gains or losses in 2023 and net gains of $13.5 million in 2022 in “Other expense (income), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

### NOTE 10. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Net income per common share was computed as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions, except per share amounts)** | **2024** | | **2023** | | **2022** | |
| (A) Net income | $ | 704.9 | $ | 503.0 | $ | 757.1 |
| (B) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding | 80.4 | | 80.7 | | 81.6 | |
| Dilutive shares (additional common shares issuable under stock-based awards) | .3 | | .4 | | .6 | |
| (C) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding, assuming dilution | 80.7 | | 81.1 | | 82.2 | |
| Net income per common share (A) ÷ (B) | $ | 8.77 | $ | 6.23 | $ | 9.28 |
| Net income per common share, assuming dilution (A) ÷ (C) | $ | 8.73 | $ | 6.20 | $ | 9.21 |

Certain stock-based compensation awards were excluded from the computation of net income per common share, assuming dilution, because they would not have had a dilutive effect. Stock-based compensation awards excluded from the computation totaled 0.1 million shares in 2024 and 2023 and were not significant in 2022.

### NOTE 11. SUPPLEMENTAL EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INFORMATION

*Common Stock and Share Repurchase Program*

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes five million shares of $1 par value preferred stock (of which no shares are outstanding), with respect to which our Board may fix the series and terms of issuance, and 400 million shares of $1 par value voting common stock.

From time to time, our Board authorizes the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock. Repurchased shares may be reissued under our long-term incentive plan or used for other corporate purposes. In 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $247.5 million. In 2023, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $137.5 million.

In April 2022, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $750 million, excluding any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such purchases and in addition to any amount outstanding under our previous Board authorization. Shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $346.9 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization as of December 28, 2024. Board authorizations remain in effect until shares in the amount authorized thereunder have been repurchased.

*Treasury Shares Reissuance*

We fund a portion of our employee-related costs using shares of our common stock held in treasury. We reduce capital in excess of par value based on the grant date fair value of vesting awards and record net gains or losses associated with using treasury shares to retained earnings.

### NOTE 12. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

*Stock-Based Awards*

*Stock-Based Compensation*

We grant our annual stock-based compensation awards to eligible employees in March and non-employee directors in May. Certain awards granted to retirement-eligible employees one or more years before their retirement date vest upon retirement; these awards are accounted for as fully vested one year from the date of grant.

Our 2017 Incentive Award Plan, a long-term incentive plan for employees and non-employee directors, allows us to grant stock-based compensation awards – including stock options, RSUs, PUs, MSUs and DSUs – or a combination of these and other awards. Under this plan, 5.4 million shares were made available for issuance, with each full value award counted as 1.5 shares for purposes of the number of shares authorized for issuance. Full value awards include RSUs, PUs and MSUs.

Table of Contents

Stock-based compensation expense and the related recognized tax benefit were as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **2024** | | **2023** | | **2022** | |
| Stock-based compensation expense | $ | 28.7 | $ | 22.3 | $ | 47.4 |
| Tax benefit | 2.6 | | 2.4 | | 6.7 | |

This expense was included in “Marketing, general and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately $38 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average requisite service period of approximately two years.

*Stock Options*

Stock options may be granted to employees and non-employee directors at no less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest over a four-year period. Options expire ten years from the date of grant.

The fair value of stock options is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and the expected option term.

The weighted average grant date fair value per share for stock options granted in 2023 was $47.65. No stock options were granted in fiscal years 2024 or 2022.

The following assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of granted stock options:

Risk-free interest rate is based on the 52-week average of the Treasury-Bond rate that has a term corresponding to the expected option term. For 2023, it was 3.84%.

Expected stock price volatility represents an average of the implied and historical volatility. For 2023, it was 23.90%.

Expected dividend yield is based on the current annual dividend divided by the 12-month average of our monthly stock price prior to grant. For 2023, it was 1.84%.

Expected option term is determined based on historical experience under our long-term incentive plans. For 2023, it was 6.31 years.

The following table summarizes information related to stock options:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Number of**  **options**  **(in thousands)** | **Weighted averageexercise price** | | **Weighted averageremainingcontractual life(in years)** | **Aggregateintrinsic value(in millions)** | |

| Options exercisable at December 28, 2024 | — | $ | — |  | $ | — |

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $19.5 million in 2024. We received approximately $10 million in 2024 from the exercise of stock options, and the tax benefit associated with these exercised options was $4.8 million. There were no stock option exercises in 2023 and the stock option exercises in 2022 were immaterial. The intrinsic value of a stock option is based on the amount by which the market value of our stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

*Performance Units (“PUs”)*

PUs are performance-based awards granted to eligible employees under our equity plan. PUs are payable in shares of our common stock at the end of a three- or four-year cliff vesting period provided that the designated performance objectives are achieved at the end of the period. Over the performance period, the estimated number of shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting is adjusted upward or downward based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives established for the award. The number of shares issued generally ranges from 0% to 200% of the target shares at the time of grant; however the shares issued for certain special PU awards can range up to 300% of the target shares at

Table of Contents

time of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value for PUs was $224.82, $180.12 and $163.97 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The following table summarizes information related to awarded PUs:

The fair value of vested PUs was $20.6 million in 2024, $22.7 million in 2023 and $20.2 million in 2022.

*Market-Leveraged Stock Units (“MSUs”)*

MSUs are performance-based awards granted to eligible employees under our equity plan. MSUs are payable in shares of our common stock over a four-year period provided that the designated performance objective is achieved as of the end of each vesting period. MSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the vesting period, which are earned and paid only at vesting provided that, at a minimum, threshold-level performance is achieved. The number of shares earned is based upon our absolute total shareholder return at each vesting date and can range from 0% to 200% of the target amount of MSUs subject to vesting. Each of the four vesting periods represents one tranche of MSUs and the fair value of each of these four tranches was determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables, including expected stock price volatility and other assumptions, to estimate the probability of achieving the performance objective established for the award. The weighted average grant date fair value for MSUs was $259.75, $192.53 and $141.80 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The following table summarizes information related to awarded MSUs:

| Forfeited/cancelled | (8.4) | 198.29 | |
| Unvested at December 28, 2024 | 163.7 | $ | 202.83 |

(1) Reflects adjustments for above-target performance for each of the tranches of MSUs vesting in 2024.

The fair value of vested MSUs was $14.6 million in 2024, $16.1 million in 2023 and $19.9 million in 2022.

*Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)*

RSUs are service-based awards granted to eligible employees and non-employee directors under our equity plan. RSUs granted to employees generally vest over a period between one and four years. RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest in one year. The vesting of RSUs is subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date. If that condition is not met, unvested RSUs are generally forfeited. The weighted average grant date fair value for RSUs was $210.74, $175.88 and $168.34 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The fair value of vested RSUs was $3.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.8 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

*Cash-Based Awards*

*Long-Term Incentive Units (“LTI Units”)*

LTI Units are cash-based awards granted to employees under our long-term incentive unit plan. LTI Units are service-based awards that generally vest ratably over a four-year period. The settlement value equals the number of vested LTI Units multiplied by the average of the high and low market prices of our common stock on the vesting date. The compensation expense related to these awards is amortized on a straight-line basis and the fair value is remeasured using the estimated percentage of units expected to be earned multiplied by the average of the high and low market prices of our common stock at each quarter-end.

We also grant cash-based awards in the form of performance and market-leveraged LTI Units to eligible employees. Performance LTI Units are payable in cash at the end of a three-year cliff vesting period provided that certain performance objectives are achieved at the end of the performance period. Market-leveraged LTI Units are payable in cash and vest ratably over a period of four years. The number of performance and market-leveraged LTI Units earned at vesting is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achieving the performance objectives established for the respective award and the actual number of units issued can range from 0% to 200% of the designated target units subject to vesting. Performance and market-leveraged LTI Units are remeasured using the estimated percentage of units expected to be earned multiplied by the average of the high and low market prices of our common stock at each quarter-end over their respective performance periods. The compensation expense related to performance LTI Units is amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective performance periods. The compensation expense related to market-leveraged LTI Units is amortized on a graded-vesting basis over their respective performance periods.

The compensation expense related to LTI Units was $14.9 million in 2024, $16.3 million in 2023 and $11.5 million in 2022. This expense was included in “Marketing, general and administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total recognized tax benefit related to LTI Units was $3.6 million in 2024, $3.9 million in 2023 and $2.7 million in 2022.

### NOTE 13. COST REDUCTION ACTIONS

*Restructuring Charges*

We have plans that provide eligible employees with severance benefits in the event of an involuntary termination. We calculate severance using the benefit formulas under the applicable plans. We record restructuring charges from qualifying cost reduction actions for severance and other exit costs (including asset impairment charges and lease and other contract cancellation costs) when they are probable and estimable.

*2025 Actions*

In the fourth quarter 2024, we recorded $13.1 million in restructuring charges related to our 2025 actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 90 positions, as well as asset impairment charges, at numerous locations across our company, reflecting actions in our Solutions Group reportable segment.

*2023 Actions*

During 2024, we recorded $28.8 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, related to our 2023 actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 1,280 positions, as well as asset impairment charges, at numerous locations across our company. During 2023, we recorded $49.0 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, related to these actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 1,450 positions, as well as asset impairment charges, at numerous locations across our company.

In the third quarter of 2023, we approved a restructuring plan (the "2023 Plan") to further optimize the European footprint of our Materials Group reportable segment by reducing operations in a manufacturing facility in Belgium. The cumulative charges associated with the 2023 Plan consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 210 positions, as well as asset impairment charges. We recorded $30.4 million in 2023 in restructuring charges related to the 2023 Plan. The activities related to the 2023 Plan are expected to be substantially completed by mid-2025.

Accruals for severance and related costs and lease cancellation costs were included in “Other current liabilities” and "Long-term retirement benefits and other liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Asset impairment charges were based on the estimated market value of the assets, less selling costs, if applicable. Restructuring charges were included in “Other expense (income), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During 2024, restructuring charges and payments were as follows:

### NOTE 14. TAXES BASED ON INCOME

Taxes based on income were as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  | (12.9) | | (20.6) | | 26.3 | |
| Provision for income taxes | $ | 248.6 | $ | 191.7 | $ | 242.2 |

The principal items accounting for the difference between taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and taxes recorded were as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **2024** | | **2023** | | **2022** | |

| Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from: |  | |  | |  | |
| State taxes, net of federal tax benefit | 2.7 | | 2.6 | | 11.8 | |
| Foreign earnings taxed at different rates(1) | 49.5 | | 50.4 | | 51.7 | |
| GILTI high-tax exclusion election, net(2) | (6.2) | | (10.0) | | (11.9) | |

| U.S. federal research and development tax credits | (7.7) | | (8.3) | | (6.5) | |
| Tax contingencies and audit settlements | 1.9 | | 11.9 | | (4.3) | |
| Other items, net | (7.7) | | (3.4) | | (3.5) | |
| Provision for income taxes | $ | 248.6 | $ | 191.7 | $ | 242.2 |

(1) All years included certain U.S. international tax provisions and foreign earnings taxed in the U.S., net of credits.

(2) In 2024, we recognized $6.2 million from our current year GILTI exclusion election. In 2023, we recognized $4.4 million from our 2023 GILTI exclusion election and $5.6 million related to the election made on our 2022 U.S. federal tax return. In 2022, we recognized $11.9 million of benefit related to a GILTI exclusion election made on our 2021 U.S. federal tax return.

Income before taxes from our U.S. and foreign operations was as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **2024** | | **2023** | | **2022** | |
| U.S. | $ | 211.4 | $ | 187.2 | $ | 232.4 |
| Foreign | 742.1 | | 507.5 | | 766.9 | |
| Income before taxes | $ | 953.5 | $ | 694.7 | $ | 999.3 |

Our effective tax rate was 26.1%, 27.6% and 24.2% for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Our 2024 provision for income taxes included (i) $15.9 million of net tax charge related to the tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") of our foreign subsidiaries and the recognition of foreign withholding taxes on current year earnings, partially offset by the benefit from foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”); (ii) $15.9 million of tax charge from valuation allowances due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain deferred tax assets; and (iii) excess tax benefits associated with stock-based payments, and return-to-provision benefits related to our 2023 U.S. federal tax return, partially offset by net tax charge primarily from the recognition of uncertain tax positions and tax audit settlements in certain foreign jurisdictions.

Our 2023 provision for income taxes included (i) $16.4 million of net tax charge related to the tax on GILTI of our foreign subsidiaries and the recognition of foreign withholding taxes on current year earnings, partially offset by the benefit from FDII; (ii) $14.7 million of return-to-provision benefit primarily related to our GILTI exclusion election and benefits from additional foreign tax credits recognized under temporary relief granted by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in July 2023, related to our 2022 U.S. federal tax return, (iii) $10.5 million of tax charge related to non-deductible expenses resulting from the impact of the Argentine peso remeasurement loss; and (iv) $9.5 million of net tax charge primarily from the

recognition of uncertain tax positions in certain foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by decreases in certain tax reserves as a result of closing tax years.

Our 2022 provision for income taxes included (i) $18.8 million of net tax charge related to the tax on GILTI of our foreign subsidiaries and the recognition of foreign withholding taxes on current year earnings, partially offset by the benefit from FDII; (ii) $17.3 million of return-to-provision benefit, including $11.9 million related to a GILTI exclusion election and a lower net tax charge from other international inclusion items related to our 2021 U.S. federal tax return; and (iii) net tax benefit primarily from decreases in certain tax reserves, including interest and penalties, as a result of closing tax years and the settlement of certain foreign tax audits.

*Deferred Taxes*

Deferred taxes reflect the temporary differences between the amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amounts utilized for tax purposes. The primary components of the temporary differences that gave rise to our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **2024** | | **2023** | |
| Accrued expenses not currently deductible | $ | 29.8 | $ | 44.5 |
| Net operating loss carryforwards | 137.9 | | 138.9 | |
| Tax credit carryforwards | 14.8 | | 9.0 | |
| Capitalized research expenses | 81.7 | | 59.9 | |
| Stock-based compensation | 8.8 | | 10.9 | |
| Pension and other postretirement benefits | 31.1 | | 34.2 | |
| Inventory reserve | 19.2 | | 16.4 | |
| Lease liabilities | 44.7 | | 43.3 | |
| Other assets | 31.6 | | 27.9 | |
| Valuation allowance | (72.7) | | (62.0) | |
| Total deferred tax assets(1) | 326.9 | | 323.0 | |
| Depreciation and amortization | (306.0) | | (317.2) | |
| Repatriation accrual | (24.2) | | (24.5) | |
| Foreign operating loss recapture | (3.1) | | (3.4) | |
| Lease assets | (44.3) | | (43.4) | |
| Total deferred tax liabilities(1) | (377.6) | | (388.5) | |
| Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) | $ | (50.7) | $ | (65.5) |

(1) Reflect gross amounts before jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income is expected to be generated to use existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of our assessment, we record valuation allowances only with respect to the portion of the deferred tax asset that is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. Our assessment of the future realizability of our deferred tax assets relies heavily on our forecasted earnings in certain jurisdictions determined by the manner in which we operate our business and the relevant carryforward periods. Any changes to our operations may affect our assessment of deferred tax assets considered realizable if the positive evidence no longer outweighs the negative evidence.

Net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were $466 million and $481 million, respectively. Tax credit carryforwards of both domestic and foreign subsidiaries at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 totaled $15 million and $9 million, respectively. If unused, foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will expire as follows:

| Indefinite life/no expiry | 399.4 | | 1.1 | |
| Total | $ | 466.1 | $ | 14.8 |

(1) Net operating losses are presented before tax effects and valuation allowance.

Certain indefinite-lived foreign net operating losses may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model.

At December 28, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards in certain states of $575 million before tax effects. Based on our estimates of future state taxable income, it is more-likely-than-not that the majority of these carryforwards will not be realized before they expire. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded on $548 million of these carryforwards.

As of December 28, 2024, our provision for income taxes did not materially benefit from applicable tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.

*Unrecognized Tax Benefits*

As of December 28, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $81 million, $74 million of which, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective income tax rate. As of December 30, 2023, our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $88 million, $75 million of which, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective income tax rate.

Where applicable, we accrue potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The interest and penalties we recognized during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material, individually or in aggregate, to the Consolidated Statements of Income. We have $17 million and $16 million of accrued interest and penalties, net of tax benefit, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is set forth below.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(In millions)** | **2024** | | **2023** | |
| Balance at beginning of year | $ | 88.0 | $ | 69.5 |
| Additions for tax positions of current year | 11.4 | | 15.4 | |
| Additions (reductions) for tax positions of prior years, net | (7.2) | | 8.0 | |
| Settlements with tax authorities | (4.6) | | (1.8) | |
| Expirations of statutes of limitations | (3.7) | | (3.9) | |
| Changes due to translation of foreign currencies | (2.8) | | .8 | |
| Balance at end of year | $ | 81.1 | $ | 88.0 |

It is reasonably possible that, during the next 12 months, we may realize a decrease in our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, of approximately $6 million, primarily as a result of closing tax years.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by taxing jurisdictions around the world. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of the relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our tax provision for income taxes and the related liabilities. To date, we and our U.S. subsidiaries have completed the IRS’ Compliance Assurance Process through 2021. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2010.

### NOTE 15. SEGMENT AND DISAGGREGATED REVENUE INFORMATION

*Segment Reporting*

We have the following reportable segments:

•Materials Group – manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive label materials, films for graphic and reflective products, performance tapes and other adhesive products for industrial, medical and other applications, as well as fastener solutions.

•Solutions Group – designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions, including brand and price tickets, tags and labels (including RFID inlays), and related services, supplies and equipment.

Our President and Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and is responsible for the allocation of resources and evaluation of performance of our reportable segments. The CODM's oversight includes establishing performance targets to advance our long-term strategy and increase stockholder value, allocating capital to our reportable segments to achieve those targets, developing compensation programs to incentivize segment leaders to achieve those targets, and analyzing key performance metrics to track progress against those targets. The CODM reviews the performance of each segment by comparing each reportable segment’s current period results with its annual operating plan targets, its most recent quarterly forecast, and the prior year to assess how segment results impacted our company’s overall results.

*Disaggregated Revenue Information*

Disaggregated revenue information is shown below in the manner that best reflects how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

*Segment Information*

During the fourth quarter of 2024, we modified our segment performance measure to exclude other expense (income), net. These changes align with how our CODM evaluates segment performance and allocates resources. Prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation. Segment adjusted operating income is defined as income before taxes adjusted for other expense (income), net; interest expense, other non-operating expense (income), net; and other items. Segment results and reconciliation to income before taxes are presented below.
